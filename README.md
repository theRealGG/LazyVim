# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My personal Neovim configuration for developing in:

- golang
- html, css
- Java-/Typescript
- Java
- Rust

## Prerequisites

- Git is present
- Neovim is installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/therealgg/nvim
```

2. Installation

The installation should happen automatically by starting Neovim.

3. Post setup script

To run the post setup script do:

```bash
$ sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh && setup.sh
```

## Language specific Settings

### Java

To work with java some additional things have to be downloaded and installed.

- the `lombok.jar` needs to be placed in the `$HOME/.local/share/eclipse` folder
